# partial-digest-problem-algorithm

A Java implementation of the branch and bound backtracking algorithm for solving the partial digest problem.

The initial problem was described by Ahrabian et al. (2013) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24084239). The problem and the corresponding algorithm pseudocode are described in detail in BÃ¶ckenhauer and Bongartz's Algoritihmic Aspects of Bioinformatics (2007).
